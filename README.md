Community Detection is one of the key research topics in analyzing networks especially for large-scale data where it has a wide range of applications. These applications include understanding the network structure, better graph partitioning, and optimizing graph traversal. One of the biggest challenges of this problem is to develop a scalable and cost-effective solution. The problem aggravates further for high volume and velocity of streaming data.
This repository contains a proposed novel community detection solution using the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC) metric for unweighted undirected node-grained streaming networks. We first implemented an algorithm for static community detection with the WCC metric in GraphX. Then for the real-time data a newly proposed algorithm called the Incremental Distributed WCC (IDW) algorithm was developed based on optimizing the WCC metric as well. We implemented IDW for GraphX as well so it can be used with Spark Streaming for streaming networks. The experiments show that the streaming algorithm is highly effective as it the accuracy of WCC were off compared to the centric algorithm by less than \%5  in all experiments and got the same results or better ones than the distributed version. At the same time, the performance surpasses the distributed algorithm by up to three times.
