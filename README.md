Weighted Community Clustering (WCC) is a metric that was propsed to find communities in unweighted undirected graphs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0557.pdf). In this repository I implemented a new algorithm based on WCC for large-scale graphs that incease incrementally with time using an upcoming stream. The implementation used Apache Spark as the streaming engine and Scala as the implementation language.
